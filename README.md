# VPN_Research_Website

## Background

This website documents my research of VPNs in the University of Michigan-Dearborn mathermatics course 'Introduction to Cryptography'.
This project was completed and turned in for a grade in April 2022.

These files used basic HTML and CSS to format the VPN research into web pages.
